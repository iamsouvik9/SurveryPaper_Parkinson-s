Summary of the paper:
This summary provides an overview of recent studies that have utilized machine learning methods to predict the progression of Parkinson's Disease.
The studies discussed in the summary cover a range of approaches, including the use of retinal image, MRI and vocal features as input data. The results 
of these studies highlight the potential of Machine Learning models to accurately predicting the onset of neurodegenerative disease and identifying individuals at risk.
However, further research is necessary to validate these findings in larger cohorts and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.
